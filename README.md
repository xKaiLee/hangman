# Hangman Game
This Java program implements a simple Hangman game. Players try to guess a hidden word by inputting letters or the entire word. 
The game displays a hangman figure for each incorrect guess, and players have a limited number of attempts before losing.

# Game Logic
- the game selects a random word from the provided list in the "Words.txt" file and creates a hidden word with underscores.
- players input letters or the entire word to guess.
- the game checks the correctness of the input and updates the hidden word accordingly.
- a hangman figure is displayed for each incorrect guess.
- he game ends when the word is guessed correctly, or the hangman figure is completed.
